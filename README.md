# Mental-health-analysis
This ipynb notebook analyses and cleans the data. Redundant information is removed so that data observation is made easier and computation time is also reduced. The study observes many parameters which may affect the mental health of a person. This dataset contains the 12,000 observations from various individuals all across the globe. 
The data visualization can also be viewed on my gallery in Tablaeu public. The link is:
